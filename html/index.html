            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p><b>My name is Langa Dorji, a stroke servival.</b><br>

It has been two long years since my life took an unexpected turn. I find myself in a desperate situation with no earning capacity and a mountain of debts. Today, I want to share my story not only as a cautionary tale but also as a source of inspiration for those who may be treading a similar path.<br><br>
My journey into this difficult phase of life began with two key factors:<br> 
<b>1.high blood pressure <br> 
2.excessive alcohol consumption.<br></b>
 I ignored the subtle signs my body was giving me and neglected to manage my blood pressure through medication and a healthy lifestyle. I mistakenly believed that alcohol was my escape from the stressors of life, not realizing it was exacerbating my health issues.
Two years ago, on a seemingly ordinary day, I suffered a stroke that would forever alter the course of my life. The consequences were not just physical but financial as well. 

If there's one message I want to convey through my experience, it's the importance of taking care of your health. Don't make the same mistakes I did. Regularly monitor your blood pressure and, if prescribed, take your medication without fail. Avoid excessive alcohol consumption as it can lead to a downward spiral you may never recover from.
Though my circumstances are dire, I have not lost hope. I've learned the hard way that our health is our most valuable asset, and I hope my story serves as a reminder to all that it's never too late to make positive changes.
In sharing my stroke life journey, I hope to prevent others from walking a similar path. Your health is priceless, and taking care of it should be a top priority. Life can change in an instant, and the choices we make today can shape our tomorrows. I'm determined to rebuild my life, and I hope you'll join me in prioritizing your health and well-being.<br>
<b style="color:blue;">The aftermath of a stroke is a challenging journey filled with physical and emotional hurdles. Simple tasks that were once second nature became daunting, and the burden of debt added an extra layer of stress. It's been a constant battle, but it's also been a journey of self-discovery and resilience.</b><br>
